# KinectV2GreenScreen
This is a fork of https://github.com/GiantSox/KinectV2GreenScreen/ with added features. This is aimed primarily at users of Mixed reality tools, ala LIV.tv, etc. as used with OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) & VirtualCam, etc.

This tool enables the use of the XBox Kinect V2 (aka Kinect for XBox One) as a "virtual green-screen."

## New features

* Simplified capture with OBS / similar tools
** Automatically "flips" (unflips) the image
** Lacks window borders, removing the need for cropping
* Scalable output
* Calibration mode (disables the greenscreen effect, presenting plain video)

## Usage

### Installation 

* Extract the contents of the ZIP into a directory
* Run the .EXE!

### Keys

* **`C`** - Calibration Mode Toggle - disables/enabled the greenscreen effect; this is helpful when setting up camera calibration in LIV / similar tools
* **`R`** - Output Resize - allows user to set the output window size, e.g. 1280x720 instead of the default 1920x1080. This can help with performance when processing video.
* **`Alt-F4`** - Exit the application
